# Project Log

## 2017-03-11

* Decided on technology stack
* Created skeleton project on github
* Decided on a feature skeleton
* Began laying foundation

Okay, went into AWS and created some IAM groups, users, and policies
to get started. Looks like I need some custom policies though as the 
default policies for 'full access' are god mode access everything
and the policy tooling really is completely lackluster.
